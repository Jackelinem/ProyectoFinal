				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a sensible question – while in theory, lenders have to take steps to ensure you can afford to keep up the monthly repayments (as much for their own sake as yours), buyers can still end up saddled with a mortgage they can&#8217;t afford.</p>
<div class="in-blog-wrap">
<div class="in-blog-left"><img class="wp-image-734 size-full alignnone" src="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/dummy/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/in-blog-img.jpg" alt="in-blog-img" width="375" height="400" srcset="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/in-blog-img.jpg 375w, http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/in-blog-img-281x300.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></div>
<div class="in-blog-right">
<p>There are a number of mortgage calculators online, such as the one provided by SPF, which give a good general idea of how much a mortgage will cost per month, taking into account the price of the property, the deposit available, the length of the mortgage and the rate of interest.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mortgage calculators don&#8217;t usually factor in the other costs associated with a mortgage, such as arrangement fees.</p></blockquote>
<p>While these are mostly one-off costs, they still need to be considered when deciding whether you can afford a mortgage. They will all be tabled in a mortgage illustration document which your lender should provide.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The terms of the mortgage may also affect your decision: are there missed payment fees or early repayment charges? The latter could be significant if, for example, you&#8217;re planning to use part of your pension to pay off your mortgage early. And if you&#8217;re getting one of the less common types of mortgage, such as an offset, you will need to consider whether you can afford to devote enough of your savings to make it worthwhile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Portugal’s national housing market has seen only tentative improvement in recent years, prime Algarve property has shown a marked upturn. In Quinta do Lago, for example, the very best properties have exceeded their pre-crisis peak.</p>
<div class="in-blog-wrap">
<div class="in-blog-left"><img class="alignnone wp-image-806 size-full" src="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Mediterranean-Villa-Alberto-Rubio_11.png" alt="Mediterranean-Villa-Alberto-Rubio_11" width="375" height="400" srcset="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Mediterranean-Villa-Alberto-Rubio_11.png 375w, http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Mediterranean-Villa-Alberto-Rubio_11-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></div>
<div class="in-blog-right">
<p>The rise comes as many wealthy individuals find themselves fully invested in first-tier cities, where prices are at a high plateau, and are now looking at second-tier cities and leisure retreats like Quinta do Lago.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consequently stock levels remained low, which has been a major driver of price growth as demand has returned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Central to the appeal of the Algarve is its excellent connectivity to the rest of Europe. Annual passengers numbers at Faro airport exceeded six million for the first time in 2014, an increase of 34 per cent of the previous decade.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The airport provides direct links to 80 destinations across Europe, of which 23 are to UK airports. Faro airport is undergoing a €32million expansion and remodelling programme that will result in a 25 per cent increase in peak passenger flow capacity. Therefore, with its low levels of supply and a product tailored to the luxury second home market, we believe prime Algarve is in the perfect position to benefit from strengthening demand in the years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of factors to take into consideration when letting your property out and if you’ve never done it before it can be a daunting task. Here are some of the things new landlords need to think about:</p>
<div class="in-blog-wrap">
<div class="in-blog-left"><img class="alignnone wp-image-782 size-full" src="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/actors-at-home-05.png" alt="actors-at-home-05" width="375" height="400" srcset="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/actors-at-home-05.png 375w, http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/actors-at-home-05-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></div>
<div class="in-blog-right">
<p>You are legally required to inform your lender that you intend to let your property out. Some mortgages contain clauses which won’t allow you to let on your existing mortgage, while others require notification to grant ‘consent to let’. How long do you want to let your property for?</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep in mind that most corporate tenants want to rent for a minimum of two to three years.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are only letting your property out for six to 12 months, you may want to price it more competitively and avoid lengthy void periods. We work with inet3 which specialises in landlord buildings, contents and rent guarantee insurance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Look at your property objectively as if you were seeing it for the first time. At the very minimum rooms are likely to need to be decluttered and repainted. To achieve a better rent, more works may be required – speak to your agent for advice. Make sure your property is adequately covered if anything goes wrong while your property is let, investigate options and costs for specialist landlord insurance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buying off-plan is something many people shy away from because they feel it&#8217;s a complicated process that is best left for people with a lot of property experience. The truth is it’s really simple and can be a very intelligent investment. Here are 10 steps to purchasing an apartment off-plan.</p>
<div class="in-blog-wrap">
<div class="in-blog-left"><img class="alignnone wp-image-782 size-full" src="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/actors-at-home-05.png" alt="actors-at-home-05" width="375" height="400" srcset="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/actors-at-home-05.png 375w, http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/actors-at-home-05-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></div>
<div class="in-blog-right">
<p>You won’t be able to get a mortgage offer until about six months before completion, however it depends on which lender you use. A financial advisor will give a good steer as to what can be borrowed and when you should begin the formal application process.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once you have agreed a price, you will need to pay your reservation deposit which takes the apartment off the market.</p></blockquote>
<p>You will also need to fill out a reservation form and appoint a solicitor. If you do not have a solicitor, there is often a suggested solicitor who is familiar with the specific process for that development.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When your apartment is ready, you will be sent a completion notice telling you how long you have to complete on your purchase &#8211; usually about two weeks. You just need to let your mortgage company know and your solicitor will do the rest. You will be able to collect the keys on the day of completion. After you have exchanged, check with your financial advisor when you should start your formal mortgage application process. It depends on the lender but generally it is around six months prior to completion.</p>

<p>Settled by the Romans in the 1st century AD, the City was heavily populated right up until the 18th century. Today, there are only around 7,500 permanent residents in the Square Mile, but new transport links, the regeneration of several of Smithfield&#8217;s market buildings.</p>

Great old pubs include Ye Olde Mitre (Ely Place), The Hand &amp; Shears (Cloth Fair) and The Jerusalem Tavern (Britton Street), where William Hogarth and Samuel Johnson were once regulars.</p>

<p>The earlier you register your interest in a new residential development, the more likely you are to find exactly the right home. The key to getting that south-facing garden for glorious summer barbecues or top-floor apartment with fabulous views is to get in quickly and find out what your options are.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once the keys have been handed over, the new owner of the house and the agent will usually embark on a final &#8216;snagging&#8217; tour.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buying a new home means you eliminate at least one element of uncertainty: you won&#8217;t have to worry about the seller&#8217;s end of the deal falling through. As well as being convenient for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Be aware that there is a timetable to completion when buying a residential development. Typically, a buyer will pay a reservation fee, and then a further 10 per cent 28 days on exchange of contracts. The balance will be due on completion of the build. Buying and selling your home can be one of the most stressful life situations, with the cancelation rate for second-hand homes as high as 20 per cent. There are a number of reasons why a private buyer or seller may change their minds, including a change in circumstances, a bad survey, a chain falling through or being gazumped.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to marketing a property, the quality of the photography and the way in which interiors and exteriors are presented can be the beginning or end of a sale. Photos are a buyer&#8217;s first impression and the key to a first viewing. So how can you make sure you get them right?</p>
<div class="in-blog-wrap">
<div class="in-blog-left"><img class="alignnone wp-image-797 size-full" src="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibiza-Modern-Villa_9.png" alt="Ibiza-Modern-Villa_9" width="375" height="400" srcset="http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibiza-Modern-Villa_9.png 375w, http://wp.nootheme.com/landmark/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibiza-Modern-Villa_9-281x300.png 281w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></div>

<p>Keep those lights off. Shooting for Country Life magazine taught me that getting rid of artificial lighting allows the natural colours of interiors to shine through. Be patient. Waiting a few extra days for the right weather can make a huge difference to the exterior photos.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let the room breathe. Move excess furniture out and try not to let anything block the flow through.</p></blockquote>
<p>Space in London, where rooms tend to be smaller, is often the main constraint, so don’t exacerbate the issue with clutter. Clear surfaces and clean lines are best. When it comes to books, bowls on coffee tables, and so on – less is more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Rooms definitely look their best when not artificially lit and clean windows and fewer curtains or blinds covering the windows helps. Obviously, getting enough natural light is trickier in winter so it&#8217;s essential to shoot at the right time of day. However, if you do decide to use artificial light, make sure there are no broken light bulbs as this can make the light uneven across the room.</p>
